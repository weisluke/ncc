# ncc
ncc (num_caustic_crossings) is a parallelized code that calculates the number of caustic crossings for a pixelized array in the source plane, 
using the caustic positions found from cc_finder. The user may input the half-length of the square and the number of pixels per side. 
Units are the same as those of the caustic positions.
